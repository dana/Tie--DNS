NAME
    Tie::DNS - Tie interface to Net::DNS

SYNOPSIS
        use Tie::DNS;

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS';

        print "$dns{'foo.bar.com'}\n";

        print "$dns{'208.180.41.1'}\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Net::DNS is a very complete, extensive and well-written module. It's
    completeness, however, makes many comman cases uses a bit wordy,
    code-wise. Tie::DNS is meant to make common DNS operations trivial, and
    more complex DNS operations easier.

EXAMPLES
  Forward lookup
    See Above.

  Zone transfer
    Get all of the A records from 'foo.com'. (Sorry foo.com if everyone hits
    your name server testing this module. :-)

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {Domain => 'foo.com'};

        while (my ($name, $ip) = each %dns) {
            print "$name = $ip\n";
        }

    This obviously requires that your host has zone transfer privileges with
    a name server hosting that zone. The zone transfer is initiated with the
    first each, keys or values operation. The tie operation does a SOA query
    to find the name server for the cited zone.

  Fetching multiple records
    Pass the configuration parameter of 'multiple' to any Perl true value,
    and all FETCH values from Tie::DNS will be an array reference of
    records.

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {multiple => 'true'};

        my $ip_ref = $dns{'cnn.com'};
        foreach (@{$ip_ref}) {
            print "Address: $_\n";
        }

  Fetching records of type besides 'A'
    Pass the configuration parameter of 'type' to one of the Net::DNS
    supported record types causes all FETCHes to get records of that type.

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {
            multiple => 'true',
            type => 'SOA'
        };

        my $ip_ref = $dns{'cnn.com'};
        foreach (@{$ip_ref}) {
            print "primary nameserver: $_\n";
        }

    Here are the most popular types supported:

        CNAME - Returns the records canonical name.
        A - Returns the records address field.
        TXT - Returns the descriptive text.
        MX - Returns name of this mail exchange.
        NS - Returns the domain name of the nameserver.
        PTR - Returns the domain name associated with this record.
        SOA - Returns the domain name of the original or
            nameserver for this zone.

        (The descriptions are right out of the Net::DNS POD.)

    See Net::DNS documentation for further information about these types and
    a comprehensive list of all available types.

  Fetching all of the fields associated with a given record type.
        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {type => 'SOA', all_fields => 'true'};

        my $dns_ref = $dns{'cnn.com'};
        foreach my $field (keys %{$dns_ref}) {
            print "$field = " . ${$dns_ref}{$field} . "\n";
        }

    This code fragment will print all of the SOA fields associated with
    cnn.com.

  Caching
    The argument 'cache' will cause the DNS results to be cached. The
    default is no caching. The 'cache' argument is passed through to
    Tie::Cache. If Tie::Cache cannot be loaded, caching will be disabled.
    Entries whose DNS TTL has expired will be re-queried automatically.

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {cache => 100};
        print "$dns{'cnn.com'}\n";
        print "$dns{'cnn.com'}\n";  ## cached!

  Getting all/different fields associated with a record
        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {all_fields => 'true'};
        my $dns_ref = $dns{'cnn.com'};
        print $dns_ref->{'ttl'}, "\n";

  Passing arguments to Net::DNS::Resolver->new()
        tie my %from_localhost, 'Tie::DNS', {
            resolver_args => {
                nameservers => ['127.0.0.1']
            }
        };
        print "$from_localhost{'test.local'}\n";

    You can pass arbitrary arguments to the Net::DNS::Resolver constructor
    by setting the "resolver_args" argument. In the example above, an
    alternative nameserver is used instead of the default one.

  Changing various arguments to the tie on the fly
        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {type => 'SOA'};
        print "$dns{'cnn.com'}\n";

        tied(%dns)->args({type => 'A'});
        print "$dns{'cnn.com'}\n";

    This code fragment first does an SOA query for cnn.com, and then changes
    the default mode to A queries, and displays that.

  Simple Dynamic Updates
    Assign into the hash, key DNS name, value IP address, to add a record to
    the zone in the domain argument. For instance:

        tie my %dns, 'Tie::DNS', {
            domain => 'realms.lan',
            multiple => 'true'
        };

        $dns{'food.realms.lan.'} = '131.22.40.1';

        foreach (@{$dns{'food'}}) {
            print " $_\n";
        }

  Methods
   error
    Returns the last error, either from Tie::DNS or Net::DNS

   get_root_server
    Returns the root name server.

   do_forward_lookup
    Returns the results of a forward lookup.

   do_reverse_lookup
    Returns the results of a reverse lookup.

   args
    Change various arguments to the tie on the fly.

TODO
    This release supports the basic functionality of Net::DNS. The 1.0
    release will support the following:

    Different access methods for forward and reverse lookups.

    The 2.0 release will strive to support DNS security options.
